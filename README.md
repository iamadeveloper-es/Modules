# Modules css
## Layout Light Library
### Keep it simple!



Sometimes for some reason we cannot include libraries or external frameworks such as Bootstrap, Materialize or Foundation in our projects, but we want to continue having a grid system. Right?


With this small and light library you can still have the 12 column grid system.

#### Usage: 


- m-container ->
to make a container

- m-row ->
to make a row

- m-col ->
to make a column


I do not pretend to discover the wheel but if someone can find it useful then use it!
